# Neural 
###### ver 1.0.0

---

## Overview

**Neural** is an open source library designed to easily work with neural networks in the language
**C++** programming. It provides a simple and clear interface that allows both novices and experienced
it is easy for developers to create and train neural networks.

Thanks to the open source code, any developer can study the source code of the library, as well as contribute their own
changes to improve its functionality or fix bugs. This makes it possible to make the library more
efficient and easy to work with.

What's more, **Neural** can also be used to conduct research in the field of neural networks. Thanks to simplicity
use and flexibility of the library, developers can quickly create different architectures of neural networks and
check their effectiveness in solving various problems.
